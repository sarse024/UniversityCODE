# University Projects Repository ðŸš€
Welcome to my public repository! Here, youâ€™ll find a curated collection of academic projects showcasing my work in computational engineering, aerospace systems, and scientific computing.

## ðŸ“Œ Focus Areas
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: High-fidelity simulations (OpenFOAM) for combustion, turbulence, and multiphase flows.

- **Aerospace Engineering**: Trajectory optimization, reusable launch systems, and mission analysis.

- **Scientific Computing**: Numerical methods, data analysis, and simulation tools (Python/MATLAB).

## ðŸš€ Key Projects
1. **3D Combustor Simulation**: 
OpenFOAM-based modeling of n-heptane combustion with Lagrangian particle tracking ([report](https://github.com/sarse024/UniversityCODE/blob/a9c2d5e29f7fd67f94ea93ef367374e86ee487d2/CTTP_CFD/5-finalProject/5-finalProject.pdf)).

Features: Spray atomization, turbulence-chemistry interaction, and heat release analysis.

2. **Reusable Airborne Rocket Preliminary Design**: 
Trajectory optimization for airborne launch systems using optimal control methods ([report]()).

Focus: Ascent path planning and staging dynamics.

3. **Satellite Attitude dynamic Project**: 
Developed a Simulink model for the determination and control of satellite attitude ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/sarse024/Nyx_Project/tree/3456ffc2b38f3fd6582dfdc0440f7e3b7697f0d7/SAD)).

4. **Orbital Mechanics Project**: 
Investigated the effects of drag and J2 perturbations on polar orbits and optimized interplanetary trajectories from
Saturn to Jupiter ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/sarse024/Nyx_Project/tree/3456ffc2b38f3fd6582dfdc0440f7e3b7697f0d7/OM)).
