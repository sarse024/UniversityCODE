# University Projects Repository ðŸš€
Welcome to my public repository! Here, youâ€™ll find a curated collection of academic projects showcasing my work in computational engineering, aerospace systems, and scientific computing.

## ðŸ“Œ Focus Areas
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: High-fidelity simulations (OpenFOAM) for combustion, turbulence, and multiphase flows.

- **Aerospace Engineering**: Trajectory optimization, reusable launch systems, and mission analysis.

- **Scientific Computing**: Numerical methods, data analysis, and simulation tools (Python/MATLAB).

## ðŸš€ Key Projects
1. **3D Combustor Simulation**: 
OpenFOAM-based modeling of n-heptane combustion with Lagrangian particle tracking.

Features: Spray atomization, turbulence-chemistry interaction, and heat release analysis.

2. **Reusable Rocket Phase A**: 
Trajectory optimization for airborne launch systems using optimal control methods.

Focus: Ascent path planning and staging dynamics.

3. **Satellite Attitude dynamic Project**: 
Developed a Simulink model for the determination and control of satellite attitude.

4. **Orbital Mechanics Project**: 
Investigated the effects of drag and J2 perturbations on polar orbits and optimized interplanetary trajectories from
Saturn to Jupiter.
